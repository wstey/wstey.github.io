What makes up a Python program: 
1. Programs are composed of modules.
2. Modules contain statements.
3. Statements contain expressions.
4. Expressions create and process objects.

(Program > Modules > Statements > Expressions > Objects)

Everything we process in Python programs is a kind of object. 

Unlike other programming languages, Python comes with built-in data structures that makes programming in Python easier and more efficient. Some of the basic types are introduced in the following table.
