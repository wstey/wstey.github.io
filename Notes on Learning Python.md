# Notes on Learning Python by Mark Lutz

What makes up a Python program: 
1. Programs are composed of modules.
2. Modules contain statements.
3. Statements contain expressions.
4. Expressions create and process objects.

(Program > Modules > Statements > Expressions > Objects)

Everything we process in Python programs is a kind of object. A variable is a name that refers to a Python object. 
Every object has a: 
- data type (e.g. int)
- size (e.g. 4 bytes)
- value (e.g. 10)
- location in the computer's memory

A representation of the memory location of the object can be obtained by calling the function, id (e.g. id(variable_name).

A program cannot change an object's type or location, but some data types allow Python statements to change its value (e.g. list)

Python comes with built-in data structures that makes programming in Python easier and more efficient. Some of the basic types are introduced in the following table.
