# Something about this
This is my first README! Currently following the instructions on 'Github for Dummies'!

## Getting Started
The greater the number of # before the title heading, the smaller the font!

### Diffrent types of heading 
Ok this is the last paragraph

#### Some other formatting tips
Create a different text box using ''' 

```
I'm in a blue box!
```

##### How small can this get?
Looks like any titles with more than 2 #s only gets bolded.

## The End
If you want a line beneath the title, use one/two # for the title
